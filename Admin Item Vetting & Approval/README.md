### Admin Item Vetting & Approval Plug-In Sample Code

#### For every item that is newly created or edited by your merchants, the item will be automatically set as non-purchasable (front-end and backend) and non-visible (backend), and the Admin will receive an email notification. When the Admin approves the item and set the item as purchaseable (front-end and backend) and visible (backend), the merchant will also receive an email notification.
